# About Us

The whole point of Gaymer.Social is to be a community of like-minded people who support the LGBTQ+ community, love video games and want to enjoy social media with love and respect. However, running, maintaining and improving a social network can be expensive, so [we accept donations in various forms](/support).
At Gaymer.Social, we want to be as transparent as possible when it comes to the support we receive from our members. People [support us](/support) every single day, so we want to let you know where your hard earned money is going.

## How we assign funds

When you make a [donation](/support), it eventually ends up in our PayPal account.
With this funding we do a couple of things:

1.  We keep a 1-2 month float of running costs; so we know we have funding in place should we need extra cash for things like an unexpected server upgrade.
2.  Anything over and above our running costs is accumulated in to new projects that benefit the Fediverse in any other way.
